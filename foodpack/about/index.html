                <h2>How it started:</h2>
                <p>I created the food pack for the community on the traves sub server over the summer of '19. It sarted
                    as a simple question in <span style="color: antiquewhite"
                        title="travescord's main sub server channel">#mc-general</span>, asking "What songs would you
                    like to see on the Minecraft discs instead of what they already are?" Many responses came in within
                    the next hour, some where similar to eachother and others a bit more obscure. I took the most
                    suggested songs and replaced all of the discs. I needed a name for this resource pack, and since it
                    was made for the people of the traves sub server, it was named the traves pack (later renamed food
                    pack to disassociate with traves).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="my-3 card shadow theme-control">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h2>Where it went:</h2>
                <p>Obviously, it came a long ways from version 1.0. Slowly, I added more things that people suggested,
                    and many things of my own. In the 2.13.0 update, I retextured bows and arrows to trumpets and notes,
                    in honor of <a style="color: antiquewhite" title="See the inspiration"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTWyosdkx44">Spooktober</a>. Before that, I created traves
                    speak (now English+). This is a whole new way of experiencing Minecraft. Subtle changes to the
                    language of the game, along with some large ones too (changing things like "Curse of Vanishing" to
                    "Curse of a Dad getting Milk"), change how you view the game. When this was added, everyone fell in
                    love with it. Since then, I've slowly kept adding and changing as I need to (typos if there are any,
                    which there are without a doubt, and adding more tweaks to the language). The food pack will
                    continue to grow and evolve from here out, for as long as I can keep up with it.</p>

                <h2>Textures</h2>
                <p>Various texture of the game have changed, including some entities, items, and guis. </p>

                <h2>Sounds</h2>
                <p>Most music files have been changed. Overworld background music is now Lo-Fi, the Nether is Metal. The
                    discs are mostly Minecraft Parodies. Some sound effects have also changed. The creeper exploding
                    sound, for example, has been fitted with a glorious "Awww man" before it ruins your day. The trumpet
                    makes a "doot doot" sound for every shot. Clicks are now "rar". And that is just the beginning!</p>
